describe 1 state to another state as matrix

NFA Definition
Is a 5-Tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), where
1. Q is a finite set of states,
2. Σ is a finite alphabet,
3. δ : Q × Σε−→P(Q) is the transition function,
4. q0 ∈ Q is the start state, and
5. F ⊆ Q is the set of accept states.


NFA
- Start Node / End Node(s) (accept node(s))
- Posible language input vectors (Regular Expession Vectors)

Graph
- Key For Path (next language/Reg Ex input)
- If 2 same choice pick one that leads onward on the graph add other to top of stack
- End True if end of input string and in final state(node) , empty stack
- End False if end of input and empty stack and not in final state(node)
- If Not empty stack and input empty return to state(node) at top of stack and resume from there.
